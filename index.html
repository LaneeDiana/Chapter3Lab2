        <p> Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
      and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a non
      profit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
        <p> Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We
      also provide long term care for wildlife that cannot be released back
      into their natural environment.</p>
        <p> Will you partner with us?  We need caring volunteers to help
        care for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become
        a sponser. Contact us today.
